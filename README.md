# Deep Learning-based Pain Intensity Level Estimation using Facial Expressions and Hand Gestures
This repository contains the code and resources for a project focusing on estimating pain intensity levels utilizing deep learning techniques. The project explores the use of facial expressions and hand gestures as input modalities for pain assessment.

## Overview
This project aimed at advancing personalized healthcare through real-time posture recognition and pain detection. The project leverages pose estimation using MediaPipe for posture analysis and correction, along with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for pain detection and estimation. By integrating TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe libraries, the system provides real-time feedback on posture correctness and pain levels, empowering individuals to manage their health proactively.

## Features
1. Real-time Pose Estimation: Utilizes MediaPipe and OpenCV libraries for real-time posture recognition, enabling individuals to correct their postures autonomously.
2. Pain Detection with CNN: Implements a CNN model for real-time pain detection and estimation using webcam feeds, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe libraries.
3. User Feedback: Provides feedback to users through text or speech in case of incorrect posture or detected pain, facilitating immediate correction and intervention.
4. Experimentation and Evaluation: Includes experiments evaluating the model's performance in detecting pain across various individuals and activities in natural settings.

## Getting Started
