This GitHub repository presents a project aimed at advancing personalized healthcare through real-time posture recognition and pain detection. The project leverages pose estimation using MediaPipe for posture analysis and correction, along with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for pain detection and estimation. By integrating TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe libraries, the system provides real-time feedback on posture correctness and pain levels, empowering individuals to manage their health proactively.
Features:

Real-time Pose Estimation: Utilizes MediaPipe and OpenCV libraries for real-time posture recognition, enabling individuals to correct their postures autonomously.

Pain Detection with CNN: Implements a CNN model for real-time pain detection and estimation using webcam feeds, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe libraries.

User Feedback: Provides feedback to users through text or speech in case of incorrect posture or detected pain, facilitating immediate correction and intervention.

Experimentation and Evaluation: Includes experiments evaluating the model's performance in detecting pain across various individuals and activities in natural settings.
